[Image:/images/clipbyattrib-cover-resized.jpg]

Use the [Node:sop/clip] SOP to cut primitives whose [user specified attribute value|#attrib] is [above or below|#clipop] a certain [threshold|#clip].

You can get a similar result using the [Node:sop/blast] SOP with a group expression, but since it deletes
points/prims entirely you usually wind up with a steppy, geometric edge.

Since this node uses [Node:sop/clip] instead, primitives can be cut more accurately
and the result can be a bit nicer. Often pairs well with a [Node:sop/deltamush].

:disclosure: How it works
    This node simply does the following:

    # Store a copy of the input geometry's position `P`
    # Swap the [Clipping Attribute|#clip] into `@P.y`
    # Use the [Node:sop/clip] SOP to clip on the Y-axis by a certain [distance|#clip]
    # Swap the original point positions back into `P`

@inputs
Geometry to Clip:
    Geometry you want to clip.

@outputs
Clipped Geometry:
    Geometry clipped along the [Clipping Threshold|#clip]

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group
    Primitive Group selection. Contain the clipping operation to this selection.

Keep:
    #id: clipop
    Keep primitives either *Above* or *Below* the [Clipping Threshold|#clip]

Clipping Attribute:
    #id: attrib
    Attribute to clip by. This should be a Float or Integer Point attribute, and
    can have anywhere from 1 to 4 components.

Component:
    #id: comp
    When the [Clipping Attribute|#attrib] has more than one component, like
    color (`Cd`) or normal (`N`), choose the component of the attribute that you
    want to clip by.

Clipping Threshold:
    #id: clip
    Only keep primitives whose [clipping attribute|#attrib] value is above/below
    this value (depending on what [Keep|#clipop] is set to).

Show Guide:
    #id: showguide
    Show a wireframe version of the original input geometry.
